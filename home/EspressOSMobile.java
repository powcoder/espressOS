/**
 * EspressOS Mobile Phone Class.
 *
 *
 * EspressOSMobile
 * In this assignment you will be creating an EspressOS Mobile Phone as part of a simulation.
 * The Mobile phone includes several attributes unique to the phone and has simple functionality.
 * You are to complete 2 classes. EspressOSMobile and EspressOSContact
 *
 * The phone has data
 *  Information about the phone state. 
 *    If it is On/Off
 *    Battery level 
 *    If it is connected to network. 
 *    Signal strength when connected to network
 *  Information about the current owner saved as contact information. 
 *    First name
 *    Last name
 *    Phone number
 *  A list of 10 possible contacts.
 *    Each contact stores first name, last name, phone number and chat history up to 20 messages
 *  
 * The phone has functionality
 *  Turning on the phone
 *  Charging the phone. Increase battery level
 *  Change battery (set battery level)
 *  Use phone for k units of battery (decreases battery level by k)
 *  Search/add/remove contacts
 *
 * Attribute features
 *  if the phone is off. It is not connected. 
 *  if the phone is not connected there is no signal strength
 *  the attribute for battery life has valid range [0,100]. 0 is flat, 100 is full.
 *  the attribute for signal strength has a valid range [0, 5]. 0 is no signal, 5 is best signal.
 * 
 * Please implement the methods provided, as some of the marking is
 * making sure that these methods work as specified.
 *
